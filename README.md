The goal of the project is to write a software pipeline to identify vehicles in a video from a front-facing camera on a car, It uses the Linear SVM classifier to train the classifer based on Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), binned color, and color histograms as the training features, and implements a sliding-window technique to search for vehicles in video frames
